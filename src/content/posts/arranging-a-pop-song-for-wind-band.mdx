During my days in [NTU Wind Band](https://www.instagram.com/ntuwindband/), I
arranged a few pieces for community concerts and, or occasionally for the band's
encore pieces. I wanted to share one arrangement that went a bit viral on the internet. Be warned that it's really 
sloppy! We didn't have much time to rehearse it.

## The Arrangement
I guess I don't need to introduce you to this 80s pop classic. 
If you hang around on the internet long enough, you've probably heard it ;). 
I'll just highlight some interesting parts of the arrangement:

### Original Solos
The original song is a bit repetitive. Not in a bad way—it's probably why it's so memorable—but it would be nice to have some variation 
for real-life performances. That's why I added an alto saxophone solo and a trumpet solo to the arrangement.
I kinda like how they turned out, but they're pretty diabolical for soloists.
We ended up having to cut out some of the more challenging parts, including the trumpet solo.

### Fade outs! 
Classic feature of the songs of the 80s, demonically hard to replicate for wind band.
Fortunately, I stumbled upon an Orchestral arrangement of EDM
that handles the fade outs fantastically! The music is
[Aquamarine - Jeremy Blake, arranged by David Bruce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuSvosav0sU).
The idea to end in a windchime is directly inspired by this arrangement, which used a rain stick.



You can find the full arrangement on this [Musescore link](https://musescore.com/user/73520/scores/6874611?share=copy_link).

## The Performance
This recording was from the first concert we had after COVID-19. 
It was really hard for us to rehearse for the concert, because people caught COVID left and right. 

We performed this piece at a community concert (sadly, people there didn't know what rickrolling is). 
However, we only ad-hocly decided that this would be the encore piece on the day of the concert!
The result is a bit sloppy, but this time the audience caught the joke and seemed to enjoy it more!

### Uploading of the Video
On April fool's day, 2025, we uploaded the video to YouTube.
As with the tradition of rickrolling, we originally uploaded the video under the disguise of 
熱愛105度的你 (Love you at 105°C), another meme song in the Chinese-speaking internet. 


### Gaining Views
可拉西可的古典樂總會 Kelashike, A Taiwanese page focusing on classical music memes, shared the video on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1FW2KM5JM7/).
台灣達人秀, a Taiwanese entertainment media, also asked to feature the video on [their page](https://www.facebook.com/wwwttshow/videos/1467712297936376). 
It did not go crazily viral, but it quickly became the most viewed video on the band's YouTube channel.
After a few weeks, we changed the title back to normal. As of November 2025, the video has accumulated around 50000 views.

## Epilogue
Writing this post was a bit of a nostalgia trip for me.
I've since graduated from NTU and relocated to the US, and I still miss the days when we rehearsed and performed together.

Also, it was surprisingly hard to hide the thumbnail of an embedded YouTube video! 
I might write another post about how I did that some time.
