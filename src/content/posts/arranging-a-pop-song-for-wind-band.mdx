During my days in [NTU Wind Band](https://www.instagram.com/ntuwindband/), I
arranged a few pieces for community concerts and, or occasionally for the band's
encore pieces. I wanted to share one of them that went a bit viral on the internet. (Be warned that it's really sloppy! We didn't have much time to rehearse it)
