    <h1 class="font-heading-1">Mu-Te Lau</h1>

    <p class="font-content">
      I'm a PhD student at
      <a class="link" href={nucs_url}>CS, Northwestern University</a>. I'm
      currently advised by
      <a class="link" href={nikos_url}>Prof. Nikos Hardavellas</a>, and I also
      work with <a class="link" href={kate_url}>Prof. Kate Smith</a> often. My research
      interest lies in system software for quantum computing, particularly quantum
      compilation. I focus on developing techniques that cut quantum computing costs
      and make quantum algorithms more practical.
    </p>

    <p class="font-content">
      Previously at
      <a class="link" href={dvlab_url}
        >Design Verification Lab, National Taiwan University</a
      > (advised by
      <a class="link" href={ric_url}>Prof. Chung-Yang (Ric) Huang</a>), I
      co-developed <a class="link" href={qsyn_url}>Qsyn</a>, an open-source
      quantum circuit optimization tool, where I turned research breakthroughs
      into features while leading performance boosts and code overhauls.
    </p>

    <p class="font-content">
      Beyond research, I'm a passionate musician and play the euphonium and
      piano. I was a member of the <a class="link" href={ntuwb_url}
        >NTU Wind Band</a
      > and had served various roles, including chair Euphonium player, (vice) band
      leader, social media editor.

    <h2 class="font-heading-3">Pronouncing My Name</h2>
    <p class="font-content">
      In English it's "Moo-Tuh Lau"! In Mandarin it's 劉慕德 (IPA:
      <span class="font-emph">[ljow˧˨˧ mu˦˩ tɤ˧˨˧]</span>).
    </p>
    <details class="font-content">
      <summary class="link-inverse font-emph"
        >Details for the linguistic nerds or confused Mandarin speakers</summary
      >
      <div class="font-content pl-4">
        The English transcription is an amalgamation of a Mandarin 慕德 (Mu-Te)
        and a Cantonese/Taigi 劉 (Lau). As a result I have Lau instead of Liu as
        my surname.
